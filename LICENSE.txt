The files in the libs folder all have unique licenses. Check each source for details.

RPG Maker MV's core uses an unclear license that is probably proprietary. Because this file is a derivative of the MV code, you likely only have the rights to use/copy this code if you own a copy of RPG Maker MV:

- N_SaveManager.js

Other than the above stipulation, you can use it for commercial or free software, and edit it as you please.

These files can be considered MIT-licensed:

- N_BloatSave.js
- worker-pako.js
- wrapper-pako.js
